\section{Introduction}

In 1998 Peter Miller published his famously influential paper
\emph{``Recursive Make Considered Harmful''}~\cite{miller:recursive_make}.
He made a compelling case that, when designing the build system for
a large project, it is far better to ensure that Make can see
the entire dependency graph rather than a series of fragments.

Miller was right about that.  But he then went on to say ```\emph{But, but, but}'
I hear you cry.  `\emph{A single makefile is too big, it's unmaintainable,
it's too hard to write... it's just not practical}''', after which he
addresses each concern in turn\footnote{
As a historical aside, Miller points out that memory size is no
longer a problem, because
``the physical memory of modern computers exceeds 10MB''.  Indeed!}.
Here, however, he is wrong.  Using
Make for large projects really \emph{is} unmaintainable, and the rules really
\emph{are} too hard to write. \todo{\textbf{SLPJ}:
Shall we say that (Non-Recursive) Make still dominates the world of build
systems, so Peter Miller's paper is still relevant? In other words, are our
paper and claim in the title important?}

In this paper we substantiate this claim, and offer a solution,
making the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) as a substantial exemplar,
we give concrete evidence of the fundamental lack of scalability of
Make and similar build systems (\S\ref{sec:challenges} and
\S\ref{sec:solutions}). Over the last 25 years GHC developers have implemented
no fewer than four major versions of GHC's build system; it improved each
time, but the result is still manifestly inadequate.

\item We describe Shake, an embedded domain specific language (or library)
in Haskell that directly addresses these challenges
in~\S\ref{sec:shake}.
Although Shake has been introduced before~\cite{shake}, here we describe
several key features that were mentioned only in passing if at all, notably:
post-use and order-only dependencies; how to use polymorphic dependencies;
resources; and content hashes.

\item We show in some detail how Shake's built-in abstractions address
many of the scalability challenges that have caused the GHC developers such pain over
two decades (\S\ref{sec:solutions}).

\item A huge benefit of using an embedded DSL as a build system is that
we can use the facilities of the host language (Haskell) to build
abstractions on top of Shake, to fit it for our particular use case.
This sort of claim is easier to make than to substantiate; so
in~\S\ref{sec:abstractions} we present an overview of the new build system we have
developed for GHC, and the new abstractions (not part of Shake) that we built
to support it.

\item To validate our claims, we have completely re-implemented GHC's
build system, for the fifth and final time.  We replaced 10,000 lines
of (utterly incomprehensible) makefile code spread over 200 files, with
6,000 lines of (beautifully modular) Haskell code spread over 90 files.
Not only that, but the resulting system has much better behaviour and
performance in many common use cases, as we discuss in~\S\ref{sec:ghc}.
\todo{\textbf{SDM}: would you like to reword this to shift the focus from the
line count comparison?}
\end{itemize}
None of this is fundamentally new; we review related work
in~\S\ref{section-review}.
The distinctive feature of this paper is that it is grounded in the reality
of a very large, long-lived software project.  Peter Miller would be happy.

% \todo{Note for SLPJ: there are 196 makefiles in the
% build system. This is not counting testsuite, nofib and some incidental
% makefiles, such as libraries/hoopl/paper/Makefile, which are not related to the
% build system. I expect I may have lost a file or two, or counted one which
% should not have been counted, so we can say 'around 200' makefiles. These
% makefiles contain 10416 lines and \$10764, so a little more than a dollar per
% line. Doesn't sound too impressive, but considering that there are a lot of
% comments, it's still very high. Also, if we only look into rules/*.mk we get
% 40 files, 2866 lines and \$6773, which is \$2.36 per line.
% And here is my favourite heavy-weight champion (see rules/build-prog.mk):}

%
% A build system is a critical component of any software project. It's the
% coal-face at which developers spend their days, so must be fast to run, produce
% the outputs correctly, and provide all the features needed. Despite the
% importance of writing good build systems, such endeavours remain a black art.
% The build system for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler~(GHC)~\cite{ghc} has been
% rewritten three times using \make{}~\cite{make}, and while lessons have been
% learnt each time, the end result remains frustratingly complex. As an example:
%
% \begin{lstlisting}
% $$(foreach dep,$$($1_$2_DEP_COMPONENT_IDS),\
%     $$$$($$(dep)_dist-$(if $(filter 0,$3),boot,install)\
%         _PROGRAM_DEP_LIB))
% \end{lstlisting}
%
% Taking a look at \lst"$$($1_$2_DEP_COMPONENT_IDS)" -- this constructs a variable
% name using the variables \lst"$1" and \lst"$2" (themselves macro arguments),
% then resolves this variable. It then takes the value of that variable and
% resolves it. The end result is almost impossible to predict. The definition site
% of any individual symbol is hard to track down. Many are defined, redefined and
% conditionally defined. While the first line is confusing, the second is
% significantly more so, with 4 indirections of a computed variable.
%
% Were this the only example in the build system, we might be able to solve it
% with lots of documentation. But alas, this snippet is the rule, not the exception.
%
% In this paper we show a better approach to designing large build systems. Our
% approach is two pronged:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  We use the latest innovations in build systems (specifically Shake,
% \cite{shake}), combined with the abstraction power of functional programming (in
% our case, Haskell \cite{haskell}), to remove much of the \textit{accidental
% complexity} from the build system. By using sensible primitives that compose
% nicely we are able to remove much of the heroism required from build system
% maintenance.
% \item We identify suitable abstractions for writing large build systems
% \S\ref{sec:abstractions}. In particular we describe an embedded domain-specific
% language (EDSL) for capturing much of the configuration of the build system
% (which optimisation flags are required to which tools in which modes), cleanly
% separating this configuration from the rest of the build system.
% \end{itemize}
%
% We have used our approach to write a new GHC build system \S\ref{sec:ghc}. The
% new build system is about half the length of the previous one (5,824 lines as
% opposed to 10,952). \todo{The new system has reasonable chunks of the old system
% as comments. Should check non-comment and non-blank lines.} More satisfyingly,
% the new build system remains intelligible, and hopefully will not require
% further rewrites.
%
% % SimonM: the new build system is still missing some functionality,
% % correct?  So how can we get an accurate comparison of size?
%
% %  \item Motivating examples of mission-critical build systems, perhaps, from
% %  Standard Chartered and/or Facebook?
%
% ~\\
% \textbf{Contritubions}:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item A convincing demonstration for the need of abstractions,
%   their benefits for maintenance and use.
%   \item Design pattern for a DSL and escape hatch (Neil)
%   \item Particular set of abstractions for GHC.
%   \item "New" abstractions in Shake: oracles, resources, unchanging files.
%   \item How Shake solves make's problems
%   \item Non-recursive Make Considered Harmful.
%   \item Version 5 of GHC build system; the paper is informed by
%   experience of a truly large scale build system (used to
%   have 800 files with N generated).
%   \item Flag provenance tracking and simpler provenance as no
%   generated files.
% \end{itemize}
