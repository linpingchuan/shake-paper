\section{Shaking up GHC\label{sec:ghc}}

In this section we report on our experience on applying the techniques presented
so far to building a large-scale software project: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

\subsection{Overview of GHC}

High-level design of the GHC build system (bootstrapping, stages,
packages, ways, etc.). Why is it so difficult with \texttt{Make}.

\subsection{Achieved results}

Summary: \emph{How we used better tools and abstractions to do better.}

Qualitative results: easier to understand and maintain. Can we say this? Or do
we need a proper user study?

Quantitative results: benchmarking, profiling, achieved parallelism.

We used parallelism to speed up some phases. Show profiles showing ghc-cabal was a bottleneck.
