\section{Dynamic and fine-grain dependencies\label{section-dependencies}}
Or, perhaps more generally: \emph{Accurate dependencies}. Why accurate
dependencies are important? 1) Performance. 2) Correctness. Anything else?

The core of the challenge: the dependency graph is not static and it is not
known in advance.

Two specific instances of the accurate dependencies challenge are: \emph{dynamic
dependencies} and \emph{fine-grain dependencies}.

\subsection{Dynamic dependencies}

We handle dynamic dependencies using \textsc{Shake}'s oracles. Examples: import
and include dependencies.

\subsection{Fine-grain dependencies}

We have the following fine-grain dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Depend on individual configuration flags provided in `system.config'
  file. When a flag is changed only the affected rules are rerun.
  \item Compute build arguments from target filename.
\end{itemize}
